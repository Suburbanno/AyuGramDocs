# AyuGram

**AyuGram** is a Telegram client focusing on improving life with features that can't be implemented in regular clients.

We have **Android** and **Desktop** versions.

!!!WARNING
It is advanced client. You'll have to spend **a lot** of your time exploring all features.
If you're not ready to waste your time on tests - better **stick up with another client**.
!!!

!!!
Note that our client **breaks [developer Telegram ToS](https://core.telegram.org/api/terms#1-privacy-amp-security)**, implementing features as:
- Saving deleted messages and history
- Ghost Mode
- Seeing self-destructing messages after expiring
- Message filters

***AyuGram** pretends to be an official application to Telegram. If you look at the list of sessions, you'll see yourself using a **regular** Telegram rather than AyuGram.
Generally, developer ToS apply only to developers, by restricting their application keys. But since we're using official ones, Telegram can't block our client. And since it's applied only to developers, they can't ban you, except if you're doing bad things that violate [user ToS](https://telegram.org/tos).
But as we've seen a lot of times, the Telegram team likes to change rules without notifying.*

So, we just have to say that:

> **We are not responsible for the possible blocking of your account. Use the client at your own risk.**
